## 📌 Project Description
This Power BI project analyzes over a century of global airplane crash data, with the goal of identifying patterns, causes, and risk zones related to aviation incidents. Using data from 1918 to 2022, we focused on understanding crash root causes, survival trends, aircraft risks, and flight phase vulnerabilities. The dashboard enables aviation stakeholders to assess safety risks and make informed, preventive decisions.

## 🎯 Project Objective
- Identify common root causes of aviation accidents  
- Reveal crash distribution by region, aircraft, and flight phase  
- Highlight survival trends and aircraft safety profiles  
- Provide strategic recommendations for improving aviation safety

## 🔧 Tools Used
- **Microsoft Excel** – Data preprocessing, cleaning, and transformation  
- **Microsoft Power BI** – Visualization, interactive reporting, dashboard creation

## 🧼 Data Cleaning Process
- Removed duplicates and rows with critical missing values  
- Imputed missing survivor/fatality data using similar aircraft or flight type averages  
- Standardized inconsistent labels for aircraft, regions, causes, and operators  
- Created calculated columns: survival ratios, phase-specific crash rates  
- Flagged outliers and data gaps for contextual review  

> **Note:** Data limitations included the absence of aircraft age, pilot experience, and incomplete crash logs for early decades and underreported regions.

## 🔍 Summary of the Process
The project followed these key steps:  
- Data exploration and profiling in Excel  
- Cleaning and feature engineering  
- Root cause tagging: Human, Technical, Environmental  
- Visualization setup in Power BI with slicers and filters  
- Analytical breakdown by flight phase, aircraft model, crash type, region  
- Deriving insights, trends, and actionable recommendations

## 📊 Insights
- The **United States** had the highest number of crashes (6,601), followed by Russia and Brazil.  
- **Takeoff/Climb and Landing/Descent** were the riskiest flight phases, accounting for over 70,000 crashes combined.  
- **Human error** was the most dominant cause, especially in North America and Europe.  
- **Technical failures** were linked to older aircraft models like **Douglas C-47** and **Boeing 737-200**.  
- **Environmental causes** (weather-related) were more common in North America.  
- Aircraft like the **PZL-MIELEC AN-2** had the highest survival rate.  
- **Unscheduled flights** showed higher fatality rates, raising questions about regulatory gaps.  
- **Crew members** had lower survival rates than passengers, especially in high-impact crashes.  
- **Security breaches and sabotage** were disproportionately reported in European regions.

## 👁 Observations
- Scheduled commercial aviation has the highest exposure, with ~6,000 reported incidents.  
- Summer months (June–August) had crash peaks, possibly due to high travel volumes and weather turbulence.  
- Survivability varies drastically across aircraft models and crash phases.  
- Older aircraft remain in service across certain regions, correlating with higher technical incidents.  
- Fatality-to-survivor ratios are much higher during cruise and descent than in takeoff or ground handling phases.

## ✅ Recommendations
- **Human Factor Training**: Mandatory simulation-based CRM training and routine mental fitness evaluations for pilots.  
- **Retirement of Legacy Aircraft**: Audit and phase out high-risk models like Douglas C-47 and B737-200; enforce stricter maintenance schedules.  
- **Weather System Enhancement**: Invest in predictive AI-driven weather tools integrated with cockpit systems and regional ATC coordination.  
- **Tighter Regulation for Unscheduled Flights**: Apply global safety benchmarks and oversight to military, private, and charter flights.  
- **Aircraft Design Review**: Analyze high-survivability models for safer cockpit structures and passenger shielding.  
- **Regional Risk Mitigation**: Prioritize audits in high-incident regions and encourage real-time crash and near-miss reporting systems.  
- **Enhanced Safety Campaigns**: Create educational resources around safe aircraft types, travel seasons, and operator compliance.

## ⚠️ Challenges Faced
- Missing technical variables (pilot hours, maintenance records) limited causality depth  
- Label inconsistencies required extensive normalization  
- Underreporting in some regions introduced geographical bias  
- Older records (pre-1950) lacked metadata like crash cause, making trend alignment difficult

## 🧹 Strategic Value
This project empowers aviation safety authorities, airlines, and data scientists with a centralized, interactive tool to monitor aviation incidents, understand historical safety gaps, and proactively build safer flight systems. The dataset, when enriched further, holds potential for predictive modeling, crash prevention systems, and policy reform.
